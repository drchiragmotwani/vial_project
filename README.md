# Vial Color Detection
Simulation of vial color detection demonstrating a usecase of raycast in detecting material color in Unity 3D.

In clinics, various vials are used to store clinical samples for which each vial is color coded. This program simulates detection of the color of the vial using RayCast to hit the material and detects its color.
